# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The command above will make the following changes to your local environment:

üì¶ Install the required dependencies.
üõ† Setup the necessary scripts to run and build Storybook.
üõ† Add the default Storybook configuration.
üìù Add some boilerplate stories to get you started.
Depending on your framework, first build your app and then check that everything worked by running:

NPM
YARN
# Starts Storybook in development mode
### `npm storybook`

Functionality covered
I have used storybook along with React and Typescript to complete this assignment. As I mentioned earlier, I take this opportunity to explore storybook.  However, I didn‚Äôt get time to explore JSON:API. So, I have used REST API.  I have summarized the functional and technical implementation I did as part of this sssignment.
Hero only
‚Ä¢	Implemented two components such as mobile and desktop to test lower resolution devices, and also higher resolution devices  
‚Ä¢	Created two dynamic buttons (Primary, Secondary)
‚Ä¢	Different design for mobile and hero banner 
 Search results only
‚Ä¢	Implemented 3 stories such as Product with Image, Pagination and product details navigation  
‚Ä¢	Product with image displays product list with collection of products cards 
‚Ä¢	Product with pagination have pagination limited to 10 pages
‚Ä¢	Page click renders new list of products dynamically
‚Ä¢	Product details ‚Äì Product cards can be clickable that loads the product detail page
‚Ä¢	Product details renders with basic styles

 Hero and search results (Page)
This renders Hero and product list as a page
Technical Implementation
‚Ä¢	Typescript features and best practices
‚Ä¢	React functional component, hooks, custom hooks
‚Ä¢	Well defined project structure
‚Ä¢	BEM structure
‚Ä¢	Module scss
‚Ä¢	Partial responsive

Things to Implement
‚Ä¢	Unit test/ Visual regression test
‚Ä¢	Content caching using JSON:API
‚Ä¢	Utilise component into application
‚Ä¢	Use decorator and action from storybook
‚Ä¢	Use mock data in story
